# C Projects Roadmap

A structured collection of C programming projects categorized by Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced skill levels.  
Each project is organized into three implementation levels to guide learners from basic logic to clean, efficient code.

Ideal for learners building a strong foundation in C, and developers revisiting core programming concepts through hands-on practice.

## Project Structure

Each project is structured like this:

```
project-name/
├── level1/    # Basic implementation
├── level2/    # Modular and more optimized version
└── level3/    # Best practices, clean structure, possible extensions
```

### Level Definitions

- **Level 1 (Foundation):**  
  Focuses on solving the problem using basic programming constructs. Emphasis is on getting the logic right, not optimization or modularity.

- **Level 2 (Structured):**  
  Introduces proper function decomposition, modularity, code reuse, and slightly optimized logic.

- **Level 3 (Refined):**  
  Follows best coding practices (naming, formatting, error handling), uses pointers or dynamic memory if applicable, and may include feature extensions.
